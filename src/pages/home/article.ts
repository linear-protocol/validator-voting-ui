## Context: NEAR’s Current Inflation and Drawbacks

NEAR’s token economics currently rely on a **fixed 5% annual inflation rate** on the total token supply. This rate was set at mainnet launch with the expectation that high network usage (and fee burns) would bring net inflation down to \~2-3%. In reality, **fee burns have been minimal (only \~0.1% of supply burned over the past year)**, so nearly the full 5% inflation is hitting the supply. This translates to **over 60 million new NEAR tokens minted each year**, significantly expanding the supply. Such **excess inflation dilutes existing holders and gradually devalues the NEAR token price**.

The current **5% fixed inflation** is **too high relative to usage**, causing unnecessary token supply growth and dilution. The NEAR community needs a more **sustainable inflation model** that curbs inflation while still rewarding stakers and securing the network.

## Proposed Inflation Change

**Proposal Summary:** *Change NEAR’s maximum inflation from 5% to 2.5%*

**Rationale:** With \~0.1% of total supply burnt in transaction fees every year, 2.5% maximum inflation would result in an actual inflation of 2.4%, which is much healthier than the 4.9% we have today and make the economics of the protocol more sustainable. In addition, the current \~9% staking yield makes it unattractive for token holders to use NEAR Defi.

Maintaining a fixed maximum inflation rate makes it easy for the community to understand how tokenomics works and adjustment can be done on a regular basis through voting when the House of Stake is properly set up.

**Inflation Impact:** Inflation will be reduced to roughly 2.4%. Staking yield will be reduced to 4.5% assuming 50% of the total supply is staked. If some stakers decided to withdraw their stake due to lower yield, the staking yield will increase accordingly. There will be a much stronger incentive for NEAR token holders to put $NEAR into Defi.

**Why Now?** Reducing NEAR’s inflation is an urgent priority. Every additional month of the status quo means **millions of new NEAR entering circulation**, which is not only dilutive but also unnecessary given the low fee burn. **High inflation without high usage is unsustainable.** Furthermore, with **multiple other networks already taking action to lower inflation**, it’s crucial for NEAR to **move quickly** or risk having a less attractive token economy for investors and users. This proposal addresses a core economic concern and aligns NEAR with a healthier, leaner inflation level sooner rather than later.

## Conclusion and Call to Action

In conclusion, **adopting a change to the inflation model is a critical upgrade to NEAR’s economics**. It will **substantially reduce inflation** (from the current effective \~5% down to \~2.5%) while **preserving strong staking incentives** and network security.

Such a change puts NEAR in line with other leading blockchains that are optimizing their tokenomics, and it showcases our community’s proactiveness in responding to economic realities. **Lower inflation and controlled token issuance will enhance confidence in NEAR**, benefiting all stakeholders by reducing unnecessary dilution and potentially supporting a more robust token value.
